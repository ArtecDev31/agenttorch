   - Reward-based learning

2. **Expert Agents**
   - DataPreprocessingAgent: Specialized in data normalization and standardization
   - ModelTrainingAgent: Optimizes model training process
   - HyperparameterAgent: Handles hyperparameter optimization
   - DynamicTaskAgent: Adapts to various tasks dynamically

3. **Task Management**
   - Priority-based task scheduling
   - Dynamic task assignment
   - Agent capability matching

## Usage

```python
import torch
from torch.nn import Sequential, Linear
from torch.nn.modules.agent_integration import convert_to_agentzeka

# Create traditional PyTorch model
model = Sequential(
	Linear(10, 20),
	Linear(20, 5)
)

# Convert to AgentZeka model
agent_model = convert_to_agentzeka(model)

# Use the model with agent-based optimization
x = torch.randn(32, 10)
output = agent_model(x)
```
